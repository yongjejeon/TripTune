# Health Connect Permission - Alternative Method

Since TripTune isn't appearing in Health Connect app, use Android Settings instead:

## Method 1: Android Settings (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Open Settings** on your phone
2. **Search for "TripTune"** in settings search
3. **Tap on TripTune app**
4. **Tap "Permissions"**
5. **Look for "Physical activity" or "Body sensors"**
6. **Enable it** (toggle ON)

OR

1. **Settings → Apps → TripTune**
2. **Permissions**
3. **Enable "Physical activity" / "Body sensors"**

## Method 2: Check Current Permissions

Let me add a button to check what permissions are currently granted.

## Method 3: Force Permission Dialog

Instead of using `requestPermission()`, we can try opening Health Connect directly to the permission screen.
